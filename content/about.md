About me
============
I am a graduate student who has successfully combined his formation as a physicist and as an engineer to work in planning, design, assembly and analysis of experimental projects ranging from simple physics demonstrations to more complex experiments.

Currently at ICFO I am a fourth year PhD student working in the area of Weak Measurements under the supervision of Juan P. Torres in the group of quantum Engineering of Light . At the same time I am a very active member of the student chapter of ICFO. In the chapter we have been involved in different outreach demonstrations as well as other activities aimed to enrich the profiles of the students by sharing their knowledge with other coleagues through tutorials and seminars. 

Before ICFO, I mainly worked in two projects in Colombia. In the first, called “Experimentos demostrativos de física Uniandes”1 I worked on live demonstrations aimed to motivate the students towards the study of different fisical concepts. In the second, while I was a undergraduate student, I worked in the project “pequeños científicos”, where middle school kids learn natural sciences by means of the scientific method. Both projects where successfully implemented thanks to the fact that the problems addressed were taken from everydat life, so that they were closer to the students and more prone to be performed in other scenarios with family and friends.
In summary I'm a physicist who likes to work in experimental physics in the advanced level while enjoys to participate in different activities to spread the word about physics and photonics to the general public.
